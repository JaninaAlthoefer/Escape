# Escape
Final year Student Project

This serious game depicts a the struggles of Civil War. it is a 3D sidescroller with a stealth element to it.

For this project I was Lead Programmer (Enemy AI & game logic) and Audio Designer. Additionally, I helped with the Opening Cinematic and Event Triggers.

For the AI I wanted to develop a Evolutionary Learning based AI that would adapt to the playstyle. Unfortunately, this part of the project had to be put on hold when a member of the team had to leave.
Afterwards, I started implementing game logic, like pick-ups and game interactions. The enemy AI was developed to a point where it was functioning and attacking the player character on sight.

For the Audio Design, I met with a team of Sound students to discuss the audio that would suit the game and in coopertation with their project, they would record, mix and deliver sound & music files for the project.
Half the sounds that had been discussed were delivered and after that I started gathering additional sound files that were needed.

Then, I used all these sound files to create a supporting soundscape to the games mood. For this I used procedurally generating sound queues that guided the player along their way through the environment, used one-shot sound effects to furher outline the games environemnt and audio feedback for the player depending on their in-game situation.
